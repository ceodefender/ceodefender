# :man_technologist: About Me

Cybersecurity is my job, and so I do it not only as a professional, but as a passion.  
I am a Blue Teamer specialized in SOC operations, digital forensics, incident response, and malware analysis.  
I have hands-on exposure to platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and LetsDefend where I practice threat hunting, SIEM, and defensive security measures most of the time.  

Although the Blue Teaming field is my primary specialty, I do some work as well in Red Teaming to better the understanding of the methods used by the intruders.  
My passion for cybersecurity prompts me to generate content in the form of blogs, tutorials, and reports on real attack-defense situations.
